Paul Wilmott’s program of study

I – Introduction

In his famous book http://iman.sn/bibliotek/livres/filieres/banque-finance-assurance/pdfs/paul-wilmott-on-quantitative-finance.pdf, Paul Wilmott highlighted several program of studies about numerical methods (especially finite difference and monte-carlo simulation). The purpose of this git-hub stream will be to follow this program about PDE and show numerical results for Securities finance products, mostly for derivatives (Total return swaps)

II – Programs of study
Programs of study are following ones:

   - I-Explicit method for vanilla TRS 
   - II-Explicit method for cancellable TRS 
   - III-Crank–Nicolson for vanilla TRS 
   - IV-Crank–Nicolson for cancellable TRS
   - V-Explicit method for path-dependent embedded option on a single equity : performance/financing barrier, average performance price/strike, lookback
   - VI-TRS on Bonds and interest rate dependencies
   - VII-Two-factor explicit, with both stochastic asset and interest rate
   - VIII-Two-factor implicit, with both stochastic asset and interest rate
   - IX-Bonus : TRS on equity with jump process

III – Disclaimers
-	For each stream, a summary documentation will be attached (merely mathematical oriented)
-	Targets are Python and C++ codes, and especially numerical results
-	Sources will be documented (of course Paul Wilmott’s book but also all other sources)
-	Python and C++ codes will be assumed to be improved, but I’ll try to do my best in order to be in line with modern python and C++ concepts, without “old way” programming
